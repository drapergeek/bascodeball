Usage
-----

This project can be used out of the box by simply opening the HTML file in your browser. The data in the file applies to the 2012 tournament, but is an easily changeable JSON format. The formula for seed matchups is generated using a Google Drive spreadsheet, available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApBEYUkFT9bbdHBPbFZGRFQtMEEzVm0yOFZLems3U2c&usp=sharing).

Features
--------

- Random bracket generation based on [Sagarin ratings](http://www.usatoday.com/sports/sagarin.htm) and historical seed matchup data.
- Graphs of various interesting data points across thousands of bracket generations, including the number of times a team appears as champion, in the final four, and the number of times a team is upset.
